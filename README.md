- Users can search the videos from the search bar at the top of the site.
- Abort Requests - When the user searches a new topic or selects a different tab from the sidebar, the previous incomplete requests will be aborted.
- On each card, the channel link is present. Users can visit the channel page by clicking on that link. The channel page contains the channel detail like the channel logo, subscribers count, and the videos of that channel with infinite scrolling.
